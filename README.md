# Linear-Regression
A continuous dependent variable (target variable) can be predicted using the statistical technique of linear regression by taking into account one or more independent variables (predictor variables). According to this method, there is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, meaning that changes in the independent variables will cause a corresponding change in the dependent variable. In other words, the purpose of linear regression is to ascertain the degree to which the value of the dependent variable may be predicted by one or more variables.
